        question:"What is driving like in Maharashtra?",
         answer:"The main routes you will be using while in Maharashtra are the Eastern and Western Express Highways, and due to the city's large population, the roads and highways can be quite congested. Despite the congestion, parking choices are usually available. Drivers in India are required by law to always keep left, and the consequences of breaking this law include accidents, traffic tickets or both. You should never operate your mobile phone while driving. Also, don't park on the footpath, drive too fast, drive while drunk or ignore traffic signals. Look out for the city's silent zones, and don’t honk, to avoid unnecessary fines. Given that traffic rules can change, contact the Maharashtra traffic police for updates and clarification."
